### About

I am passionate about enhancing human processes through mindful technology implementation, always seeking ways to maximize efficiency, innovation, and value creation.

Experienced Technical Project Manager, Cloud Solutions Architect (AWS Certified), and Electronics Engineer with over 18 years of expertise spanning software development, IT infrastructure, cloud computing, and maritime electronics. I specialize in leading end-to-end Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) processes, implementing world-class standards and best practices to drive innovation and operational efficiency.

With a strong foundation in both hardware and software development, I have successfully designed, built, and launched multiple digital and embedded solutions â€”from initial business concepts to full-scale deployment and post-delivery support. 

Beyond technical proficiency, I have a proven track record in project and team management, having led engineering, customer success, and technical support teams across industries such as food production, supply chain, banking, and digital transformation for the public sector. I have managed teams of up to 35 professionals, focusing on fostering a collaborative, high-performance culture while ensuring alignment with agile methodologies (Scrum) and ITILv4 best practices.

As Field Service Technical Manager at Alliance Nav, I am a proud member of the Maritime Field Service Operations Team, collaborating closely with our customers to ensure the seamless installation, commissioning, maintenance, and reliable performance of critical navigation, communication, and maritime electronic systems.

Professional with more than 17 years of experience on a wide range of technical skills from electronics engineering, maritime navigation electronics systems, satellite and radio communications systems and the complete Software Development Life Cycle applying world class standards and best practices including expertise as Cloud Practitioner and Solutions Architect with a certification from Amazon Web Services. I have served as manager of technical support teams, software engineering teams, and customer success teams for industries like food producers, supply chain/distributors, banking, and digital transformation for the public sector (_Digital Government_) managing a team of 35 people.

Throughout my career I have developed several hardware and software products starting from business concepts and working on all intermediate stages of development until products and projects were delivered to end users, and post delivery operational support.

I am passionate about enhancing and extending human processes through mindful implementation of technological tools; always in the lookout for ways to be more effective in the addition of value to everyone involved in my personal and professional life.  I live in Panama City, Republic of Panama; with my wife Maryu and our children, Stella and Leonardo.
